## Smash 4 Data

View Smash 4 character scripts/hitbox/animation length and stage data, data can also be viewed by patch version (currently from 1.1.0 - 1.1.6)

This app was designed for Smash Ultimate but doing it for Smash 4 as well for testing and getting feedback. The objective of making it is 
to allow viewing the game's data as soon as the tools needed to read the game files are available and the data can be interpreted by researchers 
(example: knowing which values are hitbox data) and making it public using a script which parses it and stores it into files this app uses to generate the views that display the data

### Known issues

* Cloud's final hit of Cross Slash hitbox is missing on the true condition (1.1.0 - 1.1.5, fixed on 1.1.6)
* Grabboxes AirGround value is 0 and hits aerial/grounded is always false (1.1.0 - 1.1.5, fixed on 1.1.6)
* Peach's Fsmash hitboxes (1.1.0 - 1.1.6, 1.1.6 has less issues but still in progress)
