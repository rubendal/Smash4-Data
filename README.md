### About this app

This app was designed for Smash Ultimate but doing it for Smash 4 as well for testing and getting feedback. The objective of making it is 
to allow viewing the game's data as soon as the tools needed to read the game files are available and the data can be interpreted by researchers 
(example: knowing which values are hitbox data) and making it public using a script which parses it and stores it into files this app uses to generate the views that display the data

This app is also based on the Sm4sh Calculator script viewer which only allowed viewing character scripts, other data had to be searched manually 
(like FAF using the param viewer)

### Planned stuff

* Script search
* Version diffs
